# what's going on here?!


## 1. run security check with nsp check (after installing nsp with npm)
although, you'll create a script for this later

## 2. to share the work in progress
run the app, open a new terminal window and run 'lr --port 3000'
and this will generate a unique url to share
you can type 'lt --port 3000 --subdomain andy' to get a personalised url

## 3. add a script with npm scripts
in the package.json file you can add a script under the "scripts": {}, for example:
"scripts": {
    "start": "node buildscripts/srcserver.js"
}

we can add a nice little start message script to run every time we start our server, like this:
"prestart": "node buildscripts/startmessage.js", for example,
this will run before "start" script, since we use the prefix "pre" before "start"
if we want to run a script after we use post fix "post" after a script name
(needs to be the same name, for example "poststart")

we can now create scripts for security check and localtunnel:
"security-check": "nsp check"
"share": "lt --port 3000"

we want to run multiple things at the same time sometimes!
to use 'npm run all' we can change the start script to: "npm-run-all --parallel <script> <script>"
for example "npm-run-all --parallel security-check open-src"
(to run "silently" type: npm start -s)


@see package.json for all scripts

## 4. transpilers?!

babel to transpile the latest version of javascript down to es5 (for those who don't support es6)
add a .babelrc file and add
{
    "presets":["latest"]
}

to use babel we need to add it to our package.json file, specifically to the prestart script:
"prestart": "babel-node buildsc...."
we can use it for our src server(srcserver.js) too:
"open-src": "babel-node buildscript..." and now we can use es syntax, like import express from 'express';

## 5. bundling
nowadays you need to bundle up code that the browser can consume,
but you can also use a bundler create different file structures

### 5.1 module format
es6 modules is a standardized, statically analyzable
(improved autocomplete, intelligent refactoring, fail fast, tree shaking)
tree shaking = dead code elimination
es6 is easy to read (named imports, defaults exports)

### 5.2 the bundler -- webpack
webpack bundle all our assets up into a single file that runs in our target environment, for example the web.
we will configure webpack in a js file (like webpack.config.js)

@see webpack.config.dev.js

### 5.3 configure express to use webpack


## 6. sourcemap
maps code back to original source code
part of our build
downloaded if you open developer tools (only downloaded when you need it)

## 7. linting using eslint
a linter helps you:
enforce consistence curly brace position, confirm/alert, trailing commas, globals, eval
avoid mistakes like: extra parenthesis, overwriting function, assignment in conditional, missing default case in switch, debugger /console.log in production

"extends": "eslint: recommended" --> tells eslint to use the recommended rules (warnings and errors)
           "plugin:import/errors" and "plugin:import/warning" --> adds enhanced linting of es6 import syntax
"parseroption": {
    "ecmaversion": 7 --> using version of javascript 7
    "sourcetype": "module" --> using standard javascript modules
}

"env": { --> declare some environments that lint should be aware of, like the browser, node, mocha etc

"rules": { --> any rules we want to override
    "no-console": 1 --> 0 == off, 1 == warning, 2 == error, so if you feel strongly about a rule you can set it to 2, and it will break your build
}

to use the lint watch library add i into package.json, for example:
"lint": "esw webpack.config.* src buildscripts"

@see package.json

## 8. tests
unit tests --> small units, single functions
    should run every time you hit save (automatic)
integration test --> testing multiple items (clicking and waiting)


## 9. continuous integration (ci)
let's create a ci server!
    Run Automated build
    Run your tests
    Check code coverage
    Automate deployment
Travis CIâ„¢
